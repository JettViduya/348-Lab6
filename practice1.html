        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm currently a second-year computer science major at the University of Kansas. The purpose of this website is for one of my lab projects in a Software Engineering class during the Fall of 2024. The items on this page are meant to satisfy the requirements of the first exercise.  The reason I chose the photo and the video to go along with this website is because I have been a big St. Louis Blues fan since I was a kid. It was pretty much the first thing that came to mind when I had to decide on what to actually put on this page. For context, the photo above was from when St. Louis beat the Boston Bruins during game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. I was in middle school at the time, and I vividly remember staying up late almost every other night to watch every single game of the team's playoff run. The video below is just one of the videos they would play before every home game.</p>
